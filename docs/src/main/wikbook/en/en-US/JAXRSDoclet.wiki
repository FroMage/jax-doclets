h1. JAX-RS doclet documentation

The JAX-RS doclet generates documentation for your RESTful service based on JAX-RS annotations and JavaDoc comments
on your JAX-RS resource methods.

h2. Where should you write JavaDoc

JavaDoc is read either on the JAX-RS resource methods, or their interface. Only method-level
JavaDoc is used. Documentation for a given RESTful URL is taken from the method annotated with {{@GET}},
{{@HEAD}}, {{@POST}}, {{@PUT}} or {{@DELETE}}
for that URL (in order of preference).

JAX-RS resource locators, including Class factory resource locators (resource locator methods with a {{Class<?>}} return type) are supported.

{note}Since the JAX-RS supports links to JAXB documentation, you should first run the JAXB doclet, then
the JAX-RS doclet using the [{{-link}}|#-link] parameter.{note}

h2. Supported standard JavaDoc tags

The following standard JavaDoc tags are supported on resource methods:

||Tag||Function||
|{{@param \{name\} \{doc\} }}|This is used to document the corresponding resource method parameters annotated with {{@PathParam}}, {{@QueryParam}} or {{@MatrixParam}}. Can be used at most once per parameter name.|
|{{@return \{doc\} }}|Documents the entity returned from this resource method. Can only be used once.|
|{{@link \{DTO/resource class/resource class#method\} }} | Inline linking to DTO objects, resources and resource methods to be linked to. |

h2. Linking in JAX-RS JavaDoc

The following types of {{@link}} links are supported:
* Links to a DTO object type - 
* Links to a resource class - produces a link to the resource summary, with the resource URL as the link text (e.g. {{/rest/resource}}).
* Links to a resource method - produces a link to the resource method summary, with the resource method and URL as the link text (e.g. {{GET /rest/resource}}).

h2. Supported specific JavaDoc tags

The following specific JavaDoc tags are supported on resource methods:

||Tag||Function||
|{{@HTTP \{code\} \{doc\}}}|This is used to document the codes that the method can return. Can be used multiple times.|
|{{@inputWrapped \{fq-classname\} }}|Specifies the real type of input when declared as a {{String}} parameter. Can only be used once.|
|{{@returnWrapped \{fq-classname\} \{doc\} }}|Used in place of {{@return}} when output type is {{String}}, {{void}} or {{Response}} to specify the real type of output and documentation for each possible type. Can be used multiple times.|
|{{@RequestHeader \{header\} \{doc\} }}|This is used to document HTTP request headers. Can be used multiple times.|
|{{@ResponseHeader \{header\} \{doc\} }}|This is used to document HTTP response headers. Can be used multiple times.|
|{{@include \{file\} }}|Includes the specified relative file in the resource documentation. Can be used multiple times.|

h2. Supported JAX-RS annotations

The following standard JAX-RS annotations are supported on resource methods or classes:
    
* {{@Path}}
* {{@PathParam}}
* {{@FormParam}}
* {{@CookieParam}}
* {{@HeaderParam}}
* {{@QueryParam}}
* {{@MatrixParam}}
* {{@Produces}}
* {{@Consumes}}
* {{@Context}} (ignored)
    
h2. Supported RESTEasy JAX-RS extension annotations

If the optional RESTEasy dependency is present,
the following RESTEasy annotations are supported on resource methods or classes:

* {{@Form}}
